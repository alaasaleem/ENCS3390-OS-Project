# CPU Scheduling Simulator

The CPU Scheduling Simulator program allows users to simulate and evaluate various CPU scheduling algorithms. It provides functionalities to configure scheduling parameters, simulate task arrival and completion, evaluate performance metrics and gantt chart, and support dynamic scheduling scenarios.

## Features

- Run common CPU scheduling algorithms such as Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, Shortest Job First (SJF), and FCFS.

- Allow users to dynamically configure scheduling parameters such as time quantum for Round Robin, priority levels for Priority Scheduling, and burst time for SJF.

- Simulate the arrival of tasks or processes into the system. 

- Calculate and evaluate performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of the scheduling algorithms. Include metrics such as turnaround time, waiting time, response time, and track and update these metrics as tasks or processes are executed and completed.

- Provide visualizations such as Gantt charts to showcase the scheduling activities and the execution timeline of tasks or processes.
